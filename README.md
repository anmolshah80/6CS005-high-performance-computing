# 6CS005 High Performance Computing

- Matrix multiplication using multithreading

  - Reading data from the file `[done]`
  - Using dynamic memory (malloc) for matrix A and matrix B `[done]`
  - Creating an algorithm to multiply matrices correctly `[done]`
  - Using multithreading with equal computations `[done]`
  - Storing the correct output matrices in the correct format in a file `[done]`

- Password Cracking using multithreading (POSIX threads)

  - Cracks a password using multithreading and dynamic slicing based on thread count `[done]`
  - Program finishes appropriately when password has been found `[done]` >>> [pthread_cancel](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_cancel.3.html)

- Password Cracking using CUDA

  - Generate encrypted password in the kernel function (using CudaCrypt function) to be compared to original encrypted password `[done]`
  - Allocating the correct amount of memory on the GPU based on input data. Memory is freed once used `[done]`
  - Program works with multiple blocks and threads â€“ the number of blocks and threads will depend on your kernel function. You will not be penalised if your program only works with a set number of blocks and threads however, your program must use more than one block (axis is up to you) and more than one thread (axis is up to you) `[needs verification]`
  - Decrypted password sent back to the CPU and printed `[done]` >>> [str_cmp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19600879/how-to-compare-arrays-of-char-in-cuda-c), [str_cpy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20201335/add-char-arrays-in-cuda/20201511#20201511), [cudaMemcpy](https://cuda-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial01/), [cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost](https://usc-rc.github.io/tutorials/cuda)

- Box Blur using CUDA
  - Reading in an image file into a single or 2D array
  - Allocating the correct amount of memory on the GPU based on input data. Memory is freed once used
  - Applying Box filter on image in the kernel function
  - Return blurred image data from the GPU to the CPU
  - Outputting the correct image with Box Blur applied as a file
